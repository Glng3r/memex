### Summary & Key Take Aways

In the book _The Victorian Internet_(1998), Tom Stagner goes over the major developments in the creation of the first internet using the electric telegraph. To build his argument he goes through key moments throughout the 18th century, examining the different technologies that led to the telegraph. Standage does this in order to lay the groundwork for what became the first real internet using computers. 

One of the main devices Standage covers is the Claude Chappe Signalling Device, the first telegraph which involved moving arms to position that could be deciphered by a person far away. Standage also explores the ups and down to the creation of the first electric telegraph, such as Schilling's device and eventually Cooke's electric telegraph then Moorse's telegraph.
