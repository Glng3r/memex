### Summary & Key Take Aways
 
In the article *Anatomy of an AI System* (2018), Crawford goes through the complex process of creating the Amazon Alexa. To build this, Crawford looks goes through parts of the global supply trade needed to build the Alexa and the many concerns in building it, like corruption and the environment. Crawford does this to show how taxing the creating of modern devices is for the environment and the workers that have to build it.

Crawford also stresses how something that seems so simple like asking Alexa to play a song needed an immense amount of work involving materials, labour, and data.
