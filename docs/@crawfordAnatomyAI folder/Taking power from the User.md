Same idea as the Alexa, the Alexa was designed so that anyone could intuitively use it without having a shred of understanding how it works. That is the trend for a lot of new technologies these days, trying to take away as much control as possible from the user.

> The listening system could eavesdrop on everyday conversations in the piazza, and relay them to the 17th century Italian oligarchs. Kircher’s talking statue was an early form of information extraction for the elites – people talking in the street would have no indication that their conversations were being funneled to those who would instrument that knowledge for their own power, entertainment and wealth. People inside the homes of aristocrats would have no idea how a magical statue was speaking and conveying all manner of information. The aim was to obscure how the system worked: an elegant statue was all they could see.[^1]
