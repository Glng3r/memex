This is very big. The standardization of the container means that any company that builds a boat or shipyard can easily get up and running because everyone uses the same things. This has made shipping way cheaper because you don't have to have a political war of using this standard vs another which would allow bigger companies to bully smaller ones thus growing their monopoly.

> Standardized cargo containers allowed the explosion of modern shipping industry, which made it possible to model the planet as a massive, single factory. In 2017, the capacity of container ships in seaborne trade reached nearly 250,000,000 dead-weight tons of cargo, dominated by giant shipping companies like Maersk of Denmark, the Mediterranean Shipping Company of Switzerland, and Franceâ€™s CMA CGM Group, each owning hundred of container vessels.[^1]
