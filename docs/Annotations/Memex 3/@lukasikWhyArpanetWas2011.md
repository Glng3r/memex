>> (Can relate back to crpytography stuff).<br />
Network security is a really big issue in the field of tech that is ever evolving to fight hackers and malicious software. This is important because if government networks are not secure a hacker can easily hack into this network and shut down the system completely. This would cause even a large country like the US to go into a panic while it figured out what was going on.

This upgrade of bandwidth obviated further need for the 9.6-Kbps cable line that passed through London en route to Norway.

Licklider (Lick) in October 1962 to run the program.[N] A psychologist working on human factors in WWII, a participant in the Project Charles study that laid out the conceptual foundations for the SAGE networked air defense system, a professor of psychoacoustics at MIT, and a computer researcher at Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN) before going to ARPA, Lick saw the command and control problem as having two parts: the machine processing of information and the presenting of that information to humans in a form suitable for use in making decisions.
