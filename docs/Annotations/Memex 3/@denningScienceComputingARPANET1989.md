> A careful examination discerns five major stages in the progress of a technological discourse (my analysis is guided by conversations with Fernando Flores and a paper by Joel Birnbaum 15]): declarations, prototypes, tools, industries, and widespread practices. The passage through these stages is not smooth and regular, but rather is best characterized as a drift affected by many events that make it impossible to predict what the practices will ultimately be. The time scale for the drift from the first to the last stage is long?one or two generations, or 20 to 5

>Around 1965 the first design proposals were put forth. By 1970 the first prototypes were operating in the early Arpanet. The first tools were in place in 1975; these included electronic mail, file trans port, remote login, and telephone login. Industries were emerging by 1980: community networks such as csnet, bitnet, and Usenet and also commercial networks such as gte Telenet. By 1985 widespread practices had evolved around the network, such as linking of workstations through local networks to the Research Internet, alter ations of office practices around work
