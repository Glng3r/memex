# The Early Part of Internet History That People Don’t Talk About

I disagree, while Microsoft may not be making many tangible newsworthy they have still been innovating. They made the programming language c# which is widespread, they have recently been focused on machine learning with bing, and they play a role in cybersecurity

The idea of "THE internet" vs the definition of the internet as a bunch of systems connected via a network.

> Yet the internet of today is not a stable object with a single, coherent history. It is a dynamic socio-technical phenomenon that came into being during the 1990s, at the intersection of hundreds of regional, national, commercial, and cooperative networks—only one of which was previously known as “the internet.”[^1]

The internet essentially created a whole new form of medium, digital. Something that is similar to physical mediums like books and newspaper but with vastly more creativity due to the ease of publishing original work. This allowed more people to express their opinions in public.

## Source 
> By most accounts, BBSs emerged out of the famously snowy winter of 1978, when Ward Christensen and Randy Suess created the Computerized Bulletin Board System, or CBBS, using a home-built S-100 microcomputer and a brand-new Hayes modem. Christensen and Suess were members of a local microcomputer club, known as the Chicago Area Computer Hobbyist’s Exchange, or CACHE. The club’s newsletter was a vital source of information—but club members had to be cajoled into submitting new articles, and there was no easy way to provide access to earlier issues.[^1]

Bulletin boards were something that could easily be tailored to the creators needs, this led to innovations not by some big corporation trying to make money but individuals that know what practical features we really want. Finally, something created by passion and not the wants of investors.

Very similar to the distribution of the telephone and telegraph.
&mdash;[[]]

## Source 
> Through the 1980s, the distribution of BBSs roughly followed the distribution of people. Modem owners living in densely settled cities had a broader choice of local BBSs to call than people living in smaller towns did. In metropolitan areas, the concentration of boards encouraged sysops to specialize, resulting in BBSs that served communities of interest within the city.[^1]

Lacking any central authority or advocacy organization, the interests of BBS users and sysops were hardly considered at all. Compounding that lack of representation, longtime internet advocates were generally unfamiliar with the technology and culture of dial-up networks.[^1]

The idea of online porn destroying a whole industry is interesting.
&mdash;[[]]

## Source 
> Finally, when a moral panic over “cyberporn” threatened to burst the dot-com bubble, BBSs provided a convenient scapegoat. BBSs were old and dirty; the Web was new, clean, and safe for commerce. To avoid the stigma, enterprising BBS operators quietly rebranded. Seemingly overnight, thousands of dial-up BBSs vanished, replaced by brand-new “internet service providers.” In the United States, the term “BBS” fell out of use.[^1]
