A protocol is essentially computer languages. (human language make the same sounds different languages interpret differently, but many people interpreting it the same is beneficial. Protocols are the same, if every computer uses (speaks) the same methods it becomes very easy to connect computers together).

Makes communications a lot more reliable and resilient. This also drastically speeds up the internet because you aren't waiting in a line to get access to the hub, you have many paths to choose from allowing you to always have access to a node in the network.

This way, a message that would have been an unbroken stream of binary data—extremely vulnerable to errors and corruption—could be packaged as only a few hundred numbers.[^1]

Ads were pointless if they were not seen by the right people. It was like a hope that somehow your add was seen by the right person. That's why AdSense is so popular, it specifically targets you by farming all your searches on the public web.
