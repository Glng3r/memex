> This book examines the ways that media—and particularly new media—are experienced and studied as historical subjects. It uses the examples of recorded sound ("new" between 1878 and 1910) and the World Wide Web, since the Web is a core instance or application of what are today familiarly and collectively referred to as "new media."

> This, then, is a book about the ways scholars and critics do media history, but it is more importantly about the ways that people experience meaning, how they perceive the world and communicate with each other, and how they distinguish the past and identify culture. Different versions and styles of media history do make a difference.

There are so many different aspects of the internet that talking about it broadly loses a lot of what it is. Must be specific about time and place. An example of complex from the lecture, it has a lot of pieces to it but any one small thing can break like the rocket ship example.

> Forget that the word media is rightly plural, not singular. Media are.

I think its to distinguish media vs medium. A medium is just an object/way while media is the actual information.
