> - **Abstract:** Cryptology is the science of secret writing. It is made up of two halves; cryptography consists of the techniques for creating systems of secret writing and cryptanalysis encompasses the techniques of breaking them. Over the past 2500 years, cryptology has developed numerous types of systems to hide messages and subsequently a rich vocabulary in which to describe them. In this chapter we introduce the reader to the vocabulary of cryptology, explain the differences between codes and ciphers and begin the discussion of how to decipher an unknown message.

> In early August 1775 a young patriot from Newport, Rhode Island named Godfrey Wenwood received a request from his ex-wife, Mary Butler Wenwood. (Nagy 2013, pp. 169–171) It was to deliver a letter to a “Major Cane in Boston on his magisty’s service”. Wenwood was rather reluctant to deliver the letter, assuming, quite correctly, that Major Cane was a British officer stationed in Boston with access to General Gage, the commander of British forces in America. Instead he took it to a friend of his, a fellow patriot and a schoolmaster, who opened it and discovered three sheets of unintelligible writing. The letter was written in some kind of cipher.

> A 2-part code eliminates this problem by having two separate lists, one arranged numerically by codewords and one arranged alphabetically by the words and phrases the codewords represent. Thus one list (the one that is alphabetically sorted) is used for encoding a message and the other list (the one that is numerically sorted by codeword) is used for decoding messages.

#### Definitions / concepts

> [!quote|#2ea8e5] Highlight
> It must be that as soon as a culture has reached a certain level, probably measured largely by its literacy, cryptography appears spontaneously  – as its parents, language and writing, probably also did. The multiple human needs and desires that demand privacy among two or more people in the midst of social life must inevitably lead to cryptology wherever men thrive and wherever they write. Cultural diffusion seems a less likely explanation for its occurrence in so many areas, many of them distant and isolated
