> - **Abstract:** The paper discusses the evolution and development of library catalogues from clay tablets to the web-based catalogue. In the early stages, cataloguing was a local and individual library practice. Each library constructed its own catalogue, most suited to its purpose. A series of continuous changes through the ages, in both, conventional and non-conventional catalogues, including recent technology inputs added various features to the present day catalogue. Today the computerised catalogue may function like a portal and this function can be exploited infinitely to connect to a variety of data considered useful for library users. The system designers are trying to adopt new trends in OPACs. Web-based catalogues initiated Web 2.0 trends like RSS feeds, blogs, downloadable e-media, and instant messages. The facelift of the simple catalogue was eminent to keep up with the versatile needs of the widely web-exposed library users.

> One of the most significant events in the history of cataloguing was the International Conference on Cataloguing Principles (ICCP) known as the ‘Paris Principles’ held at Paris in 1961. Delegates from 53 countries and 12 international organisations participated in the conference. Though many countries were greatly influenced by the ICCP it did not provide a satisfactory basis for agreement and several national committees rejected certain clauses of the statement.

> In India, S.R. Ranganathan designed the Classified Catalogue Code (CCC) and its first edition was published in 1934. After five editions the last was in 1964. Each new edition sought to improve the preceding one. The subject approach was recognised as dominant in CCC. It had no restriction of language unlike other codes which were of non-local nature. The fifth edition appeared with additional rules and included a feature of economy as it does not cover the use of imprint and collation in its entries

> These OPACs had an in-built circulation system, which let users know the copy status of documents and allowed them to place reserves or holds on books16. Keyword search, Boolean search and the increased or decreased of search results were among the features of second generation OPACs. Interfaces were usually in two modes-menu driven and command-driven. This made flexible interaction between the user and OPAC more flexible. In terms of user assistance, these provided more options including, help access, error messages and suggestive prompts. Ease of use and user friendliness were two major features of this generation of OPACs.

#### Agree

> The Archaeological Excavations Assurbanipal (1668-626 BC) revealed that bibliographic information was recorded on tablets that served as a crude location device by recording title, number of tablets, distinct subdivision, and a location.

> ‘OPAC as an acronym for Online Public Access catalog, a database composed of bibliographic records describing the books and other materials owned by a library or library system, accessible via public terminals or workstations usually concentrated near the reference desk to make it easy for users to request the assistance of a trained reference librarian. Most online catalogues are searchable by author, title, subject, and keywords and allow users to print, download or export record to an e-mail account11.
