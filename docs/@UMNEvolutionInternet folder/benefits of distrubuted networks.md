This creates many bottlenecks, because you are trying to pass so many messages through one location, it makes it very expensive to keep up on demand. While with packet switching it is a bunch of nodes that anyone's traffic can pass through, making a bottleneck much less likely. Even if a node became extremely busy or went down, it is very easy to find an alternative path, making packet switching resilient.

> In contrast to a system known as the hub-and-spoke model, where the telephone operator (the “hub”) would patch two people (the “spokes”) through directly, this new system allowed for a voice message to be sent through an entire network, or web, of carrier lines, without the need to travel through a central hub, allowing for many different possible paths to the destination.[^1]
