> This decentralized network could only function through common communication protocols. Just as we use certain protocols when communicating over a telephone—“hello,” “goodbye,” and “hold on for a minute” are three examples—any sort of machine-to-machine communication must also use protocols. These protocols constitute a shared language enabling computers to understand each other clearly and easily.[^1]

A protocol is essentially computer languages. Humans have a set range of sounds that we can make with our voices, language is essentially a set of rules and grouping of these sounds to be able to convey meaning to one another. Computer protocols work the same way as human languages, all computers work on binary just like we use sound, but many computers treat bits in a slightly different way. If we can come up with rules for how computers interpret bits computers would be able to directly communicate with each other.
