Kumar explicitly states, "one of ITâ€™s greatest accomplishments is transformation of the card catalogue to the OPAC to facilitate libraries (Kumar, 2013)." The ability to have a computer find the information for you was revolutionary at the time. It utilizes a database that stores many points of data like author, title, publisher, and lets the user search by any of these instead of just author or title like with the card catalogue. OPAC is just the name for the software that can be used easily by a trained librarian to search for data. It has multiple use cases like a bibliographic database, a portal to non-bibliographic data, it can even act a promotional device. It essentially takes a card catalogue and puts in on steroids.

{Use this section to think about connections. Think about **how the newly created notes connect with your existing knowledge**. If you find some connections, connect the new notes with the older notes already in your system.To find these, ask:

-   How does this idea fit into what I already know?
-   What does this idea mean for some other idea that I already have?
-   Does this add to, contradict, or explain another idea that I already have?

You link to other notes by putting them in square brackets. Remember that Obsidian will auto search as you type for notes with those words. Once you've selected a note, you can add the ^ symbol to link to a subheading or block within a note, too.}
