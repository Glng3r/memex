Catalog codes originally differed from library to library until the libraries realized the benefit of sharing the same system. The first major development was from the British Museum catalogue, it essentially acted as an inventory and finding list at the same time. It only had author entries ordered alphabetically. Charles Jewett took inspiration of the Panizzi's rules and created his own, which tried to use subject headings. It wasn't until the AA Code of 1908 by The American Library Association and the British Library Association where we got a multinational catalogue standard. They kept making revisions all the way until 1949.

{Use this section to think about connections. Think about **how the newly created notes connect with your existing knowledge**. If you find some connections, connect the new notes with the older notes already in your system.To find these, ask:

-   How does this idea fit into what I already know?
-   What does this idea mean for some other idea that I already have?
-   Does this add to, contradict, or explain another idea that I already have?

You link to other notes by putting them in square brackets. Remember that Obsidian will auto search as you type for notes with those words. Once you've selected a note, you can add the ^ symbol to link to a subheading or block within a note, too.}
