Catalog codes originally differed from library to library until the libraries realized the benefit of sharing the same system. The first major development was from the British Museum catalogue, it essentially acted as an inventory and finding list at the same time. It only had author entries ordered alphabetically. Charles Jewett took inspiration of the Panizzi's rules and created his own, which tried to use subject headings. It wasn't until the AA Code of 1908 by The American Library Association and the British Library Association where we got a multinational catalogue standard. They kept making revisions all the way until 1949.
