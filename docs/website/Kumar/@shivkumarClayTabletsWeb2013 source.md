In the introduction to *From Clay Tablets to Web*(2013), Shiv Kumar goes through the history of the methods libraries used to organize books. To build this timeline, he looks at the most popular way of sorting library throughout the ages, with a big emphasis on OPAC.

### Links

There were some [[Historical Developments]] in organization from Callimachus.
The first appearance of any sort of organization was the [[The dictionary catalog]] method.
[[Computer-based Catalogs]]
[[Development of Catalogue codes]] by the British and Americans created a foundation for other standards to build on.
[[Post Paris Conference]] was when a lot of improvements to standardization happened.
The [[Early OPAC]] was the first modern version of a library website.
[[Later OPAC upgrades]]
I think a lot of these advancements have been focused on making knowledge [[website/Kumar/Accessibility]] for people.
