Kumar noted how there were many attempts in the early centuries to create a standardized catalog, but the first primitive form of a catalogue was from the Alexandria Library and was continued by the Romans, which worked similar to how a modern computer handles memory. They would have a tablet with location and how many tablets after that was a part of the set, similar to how array's work; the computer would tell the program to start at index 0 in memory and go for the length specified in the array.
