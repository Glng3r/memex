The 14th century catalogues included an author index appended to the inventory list which could be conceived as a true catalogue

The start of the creation of the dictionary catalog Kumar found was during the 14th century, when libraries indexed books by author, which quickly changed into being alphabetically in the 16th century. It wasn't until the 19th century when we were first introduced to the dictionary catalog where it was ironed out into a very effective form of a catalogue

{Use this section to think about connections. Think about **how the newly created notes connect with your existing knowledge**. If you find some connections, connect the new notes with the older notes already in your system.To find these, ask:

-   How does this idea fit into what I already know?
-   What does this idea mean for some other idea that I already have?
-   Does this add to, contradict, or explain another idea that I already have?

You link to other notes by putting them in square brackets. Remember that Obsidian will auto search as you type for notes with those words. Once you've selected a note, you can add the ^ symbol to link to a subheading or block within a note, too.}
