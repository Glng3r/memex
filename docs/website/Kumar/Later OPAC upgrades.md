In the 70s and 80 many companies designed hardware and software specifically for libraries. It wasn't until the 80s when OPAC became very popular. It was adopted by many different universities, such as the University of Adelaide. There were many management systems that built on the foundations of OPAC such as URICA, VTLA, GEAC, DOBIS/LIBIS. Which lead to the suppliers outright building their own complete integrated systems which lead to features sch as interlibrary lending which in my opinion is a big advancement because you could find books for other libraries without having to directly go to each place.

{Use this section to think about connections. Think about **how the newly created notes connect with your existing knowledge**. If you find some connections, connect the new notes with the older notes already in your system.To find these, ask:

-   How does this idea fit into what I already know?
-   What does this idea mean for some other idea that I already have?
-   Does this add to, contradict, or explain another idea that I already have?

You link to other notes by putting them in square brackets. Remember that Obsidian will auto search as you type for notes with those words. Once you've selected a note, you can add the ^ symbol to link to a subheading or block within a note, too.}
