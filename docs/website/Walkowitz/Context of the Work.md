Walkowitz knows that the medium and the condition of it is just as important as the message. As an example, when she is handling government documents, she thinks of events such as outside influences that could have affected the condition of the document. She also looks at the medium itself, such as the kind of paper and the layers of communications.
This goes alongside the things Graham said in his January 16th lecture about how the medium of the message is just as important as the message itself.
