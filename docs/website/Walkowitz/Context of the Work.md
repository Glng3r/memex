Walkowitz knows that the medium and the condition of it is just as important as the message. As an example, when she is handling government documents, she thinks of events such as outside influences that could have affected the condition of the document. She also looks at the medium itself, such as the kind of paper and the layers of communications.
This goes alongside the things Graham said in his January 16th lecture about how the medium of the message is just as important as the message itself.

{Use this section to think about connections. Think about **how the newly created notes connect with your existing knowledge**. If you find some connections, connect the new notes with the older notes already in your system.To find these, ask:

-   How does this idea fit into what I already know?
-   What does this idea mean for some other idea that I already have?
-   Does this add to, contradict, or explain another idea that I already have?

You link to other notes by putting them in square brackets. Remember that Obsidian will auto search as you type for notes with those words. Once you've selected a note, you can add the ^ symbol to link to a subheading or block within a note, too.}
