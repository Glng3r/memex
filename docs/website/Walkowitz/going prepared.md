When Walkowitz goes to an archive she always comes prepared with essentials like a laptop, charger, external hard drive, and a camera with an extra battery. Going prepared with all the equipment you need will make your time spent there more efficent because you wont have to go looking for something you forgot. She explicitly said this as a lot of people overlook the preparations needed before going somewhere, because they then have to waste their limited time looking for equipment like a camera that they can borrow. The extra hard drive is a phenominal idea because anything can happen to the laptop that is unexpected like spilling water on it that can damage the components and even the storage itself. Having an independent backup is always a good idea for any data.

{Use this section to think about connections. Think about **how the newly created notes connect with your existing knowledge**. If you find some connections, connect the new notes with the older notes already in your system.To find these, ask:

-   How does this idea fit into what I already know?
-   What does this idea mean for some other idea that I already have?
-   Does this add to, contradict, or explain another idea that I already have?

You link to other notes by putting them in square brackets. Remember that Obsidian will auto search as you type for notes with those words. Once you've selected a note, you can add the ^ symbol to link to a subheading or block within a note, too.}
