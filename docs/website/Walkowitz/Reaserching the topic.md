Walkowitz first step before even going to the archive is reading in advance other people's own writing on the topic to get a better understanding of what information is already out there. This gives her a backgroud idea of the topic and lets her generate questions that could better hone in what she is looking for at the archive. It also makes her time more efficent at the archive because she already has an idea of what she is looking for.
I can use this by doing some independent reasearch on a topic before diving in to the academic literature to have questions and guide my reading.

{Use this section to think about connections. Think about **how the newly created notes connect with your existing knowledge**. If you find some connections, connect the new notes with the older notes already in your system.To find these, ask:

-   How does this idea fit into what I already know?
-   What does this idea mean for some other idea that I already have?
-   Does this add to, contradict, or explain another idea that I already have?

You link to other notes by putting them in square brackets. Remember that Obsidian will auto search as you type for notes with those words. Once you've selected a note, you can add the ^ symbol to link to a subheading or block within a note, too.}
