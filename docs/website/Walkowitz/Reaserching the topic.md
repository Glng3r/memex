Walkowitz first step before even going to the archive is reading in advance other people's own writing on the topic to get a better understanding of what information is already out there. This gives her a backgroud idea of the topic and lets her generate questions that could better hone in what she is looking for at the archive. It also makes her time more efficent at the archive because she already has an idea of what she is looking for.
I can use this by doing some independent reasearch on a topic before diving in to the academic literature to have questions and guide my reading.
