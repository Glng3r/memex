Walkowitz spends a good section of her article noting how she organizes her notes. The first thing she does in "writing mode," is she prints out her notes and places them in a filing cabinet and arranging them alphabetically  and indexing them on her computer. This is the same as what we can do with obsidian by creating nested folders and using tags and projects to group together similar data points. She also dislikes long notes, she compresses the information into indexes with highlighting. This is very similar to the way we are organizing information by making a source note with a bunch of atomic notes building off of our information.
