Walkowitz spends a good section of her article noting how she organizes her notes. The first thing she does in "writing mode," is she prints out her notes and places them in a filing cabinet and arranging them alphabetically  and indexing them on her computer. This is the same as what we can do with obsidian by creating nested folders and using tags and projects to group together similar data points. She also dislikes long notes, she compresses the information into indexes with highlighting. This is very similar to the way we are organizing information by making a source note with a bunch of atomic notes building off of our information.

{Use this section to think about connections. Think about **how the newly created notes connect with your existing knowledge**. If you find some connections, connect the new notes with the older notes already in your system.To find these, ask:

-   How does this idea fit into what I already know?
-   What does this idea mean for some other idea that I already have?
-   Does this add to, contradict, or explain another idea that I already have?

You link to other notes by putting them in square brackets. Remember that Obsidian will auto search as you type for notes with those words. Once you've selected a note, you can add the ^ symbol to link to a subheading or block within a note, too.}
