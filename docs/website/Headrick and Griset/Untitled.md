With the Rogers-Shaw merge it could enhance that.

Instead of it taking weeks or months for information to get from the homeland to India it could now be done in a matter of minutes.

As an example on the main reasons Hitler dominated Europe was because of the Enigma letting the German's have ultra secure communication.

But, looking at the business side, they just attracted new customers and as soon as the war is over they can just raise prices freely.
