its like a very early version of a digital signature, [joseph's memex](https://jmcn99.github.io/hist1900-memex/atomic_notes/data%20integrity/) goes into this topic a little deeper so i suggest you check it out. Its pretty much to verify who sent the message by having a code that belongs to you, something that someone cannot easily recreate.
