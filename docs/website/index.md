I have organized my files by reading, each folder with the author last name (or IEEE) is a separate reading. The Annotation folder is just all my annotations with comments. Each file is either tagged with #atomic for atomic note, #source for source note or #idea for an idea note.
The "tag accessible" folder has short notes that will be like a quick definition or an image, its not relevent unless you click on the link from the note that has it. My media stores images for some of the notes. The MyMedia folder is all the images found throughout my notes, do not worry about this folder.


Things with #memex2 is all the new stuff made for the second edition of my memex.
