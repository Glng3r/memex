-   One idea per note - but as complete as possible in your own words
-   Write as if you are writing for someone else. Use full sentences

-   How does this idea fit into what I already know?
-   What does this idea mean for some other idea that I already have?
-   Does this add to, contradict, or explain another idea that I already have?

See [the course website](https://shawngraham.github.io/hist1900/3.Technical_Help/2.Set%20Up%20Your%20Online%20Memex/).  Obsidian doesn't care which folder your notes are in, as it can always find them inside the main vault. But for your memex, items you move in here you will eventually push online.
