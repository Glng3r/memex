Often dubbed the first telegraph. 

The very first iteration that was devised was by striking two casserole dishes that could be heard from ways away, then the person listening for it would dicipher what it meant by the different kinds of "clangs." They used a [[code book]] to store what the different "clangs meant. The caveat was that you had to be within earshot and the message could easily be lost in translation. To improve on this, Chappe switching to flipping a tall board with black on one side and white on the other with each flip representing something, this drastically improved the range of the mechanism. In the final design it became a tower with a few arms that could tilt with each combination representing a different code in the codebook (Standage,1998).

#### Things holding it back
There were many things holding the technology back from adoption, one of the main ones was the turmoil from the French Revolution, the government was very preoccupied by Napoleon. Another was that the second test was sabotaged by a mob of protestors. 

#### Things that accelerated it
When they finally decided on the swinging arms it became a lot more reliable, stanardized and you could have way more combinations for codes. When it intrigued Charles-Gilbert Romme, the current president of the Committee of Public Instruction,, it led to the government becoming interested in the technology. Eventually, Chappe got help by many others such as [Joseph Lakanal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Lakanal), [Louise Arbogast](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Arbogast/), [Pierre Claude Francois Daunou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Claude_Fran%C3%A7ois_Daunou), who helped tremendously with the development. Since, the device had started becoming popular, it was also funded. (talk about the success of the first one)(Standage,1998).

## Competencies on which it lies

It lies on the users' ability to quickly decipher each position in a big code book. It relied on a clear line of sight between each tower (frequently blocked by fog).

It wasn't very accessible other than to the government because you needed to be well trained in using it and only people who did it for a living can operate them efficently. [[Accessibility with the telegraph]]
