Own stuff to add: add a note about linguistics and there is more to information then the words present, like the tone and stuff. Make a link to this note with the telegraphs and talk about how trying to get across personal information like a conversation would be tricky because you lose the tone and stuff in this MEDIUM, that is it only good for learning info, (can link gitelman and me)

I noticed a lot that it's not very user-friendly this stuff, it took skilled people to be able to use these technologies, needed a whole book of different codes which an average person did not have the time to learn.

In the sixteenth century, an urban myth of a device that can send messages letter by letter over magical needles came to be. I think this was people trying to get their hopes up about a new, exciting way to communicate to people. There was a French minister Cardinal Richelieu who people thought had one because of how informed he was. I think this could be because people are scared of the unknown, so they make up stories that are plausible to make it less scary.

Accessibility is a big thing here as well, like the OPAC stuff. The more development went into the telegraph, the more user-friendly it became (like library systems). The more user-friendly something is, the easier it is to monetizee to the public, create more drive for innovation (money).

Claude Chappe Signalling Device "telegraph"
---
Personal note, look into what Chappe did before doing all this designing.
Page 9 important.
Ended on page 28.
Sends signals by sending a "clang" by striking casserole dishes, could be heard from far away. They had a code book (talk about encryption, how they needed a way that knew to reliably translate their info) this let them translate what the different kinds of "clangs" meant. The caveat was the person had to be withing earshot for communicating. They then switched to flipping a tall board with white on one side and black on the other, with each set of flips representing something in the code book. This increased the distance the message could be sent and made it more reliable. Then, in its final design it  become a tower with a few arms that could be tilted each combination having its own meaning in a code book (can link cipher here).
#### Things holding it back

- Turmoil of the revolutionary France.
- The second test was sabotaged by a mob.

#### Things that accelerated it
- When they changed it to the swinging arms, it made it a lot more reliable and standardized.
- Picked up by Charles-Gilbert Romme, president of the Committee of Public Instruction.
- Big team to help engineer it consisting of: Joseph Lakanal, Louis Arbogast, Pierre Claude Francois Daunou.
- It was funded.
- The widespread success of the French one.

#### Social Necessities for Adoption
- It would need to work faster, essentially the workers just need to do this more.
- Proof that it worked well enough that it would be more practical in timed situations compared to other means like horse carriage.  

#### Competencies on which it lies
- It relies on the ability of the user to tell each signal apart
- relies on the codebook
- Skilled operators who can efficiently translate using the codebooks.
#### Consequences 
- Very expensive to run.
- It was only for government uses, the general population could not use it.
- Politically, it would help spread the government's opinions and help them have a tighter grip on territory near the edges of their country because only the government could afford it. 


Electric Telegraph
--- 
Started as a rumour by an unknown author who goes by "C.M."(Standage,1998). Even though this claim of an electrical telegraph was false, it sparked curiosity in others eye, who began to experiment to create one.
Nowadays, an electric telegraph is simple, just a battery with a lightbulb with someone on one end breaking and reconnecting the circuit to flash a code. (Standage,1998).
Schilling's device used a galvanometer and the left and right swings of the needle to indicate letters and numbers.
Wheatstone and Cooke's partnership created the first five needle design that was semi user-friendly, each needle could be deflected to point to a symbol on a diamond shaped grid, no need for a crazy codebook.

Morse and Leonard Gale teamed up, with Vail to provide the financials. 

#### Things holding it back
- No more war with France and England, stopped Ronald's test. (page 20)
- John Barrow had the idea of if it is not broken, don't fix it.
- That using electromagnetism, the signal will start to diminish after 200 feet (page 24).
- The death of Schilling. 
#### Things that accelerated it
- The discovery of electromagnetism by Hans Oersted (Standage, 1998, 23)
- The thought of a fortune for the person who could create an electric telegraph (page 31).

#### Social Necessities for Adoption
- The simplicity of using it.

#### Competencies on which it lies
- Electromagnetism, the first way to reliably repeat electrical signals.
- Galvanometer, "which indicates the flow of current by the deflection of a rotation needle, and the electromagnet, a coil of wire that behaves just like a permanent magnet- but only as long current is flowing through it (Standage,1998) (page 24)."
- using many small batteries instead of one large one to transmit the signal further (page 33)


[[Morse's Inspiration (pg.25-27)]]
#### Morse's History (pg.25-27)
- A painter.
- Became interested in faster information relay when he only got notice of his wife's passing and funeral a day before it.
- Was into inventing, first idea was a marble cutting device that could make duplicates of a famous piece, then he invented a new kind of water pump.
- Became interested in the telegraph after Dr. Charles Jackson introduced him to electromagnetism.
- Ironic how the lack of information travel led him to not knowing that people already tried to build an electric telegraph and failed.
#### The Morse Code (page 29-)

- Used the clicking of an electromagnet to send numbers the same way of a church bell.
- Very long.
- He created a series of short and long bursts to signify numbers from 0-9.
- Could be used to indicate a word in a codebook.
- Tried to create a way to _automatically_ write down the dots and dashes.



Morse Telegraph

##### How it worked: (page 38-39)
By tapping a key by hand, it would raise and lower an ink pen on the other side, inscribing dots and dashes. Morse had simplified his code by making characters be represented by the number of consecutive dots and dashes.
[[morseCode.png]]
#### His ambition: 
- As a way of communicating through written language, ignoring distance collapsing space-time just like the Romans with their roads.
- Morse thought it would be so easy to use that practically everyone would use it in their daily lives.
- A world connected by a wire.
- His thought of how he could have been at his wife's funeral if the telegraph was a thing.
#### Accelerating forces
- He was unaware of the earlier failed attempts, so he was a breath of fresh air in the path to the electric telegraph.
- Morse's telegraph was used officially to connect France, Belgium, Switzerland, Spain, and Sardinia. (pg 69)

The hard part for both Cooke and Morse was convincing people how great the telegraph was.

The telegraph Legacy (page 68-72)

##### Interconnection Treaties
- Prussia and Austria (October 3,1949).
	- It was inefficient, instead of just connecting across the border they made it political by having official stations with representatives in them.
	- Had to physically write down the message, then pass it to a representative from the other country.
- Agreements were made between Prussia and Saxony, and Austria and Bavaria.
- Austro-German Telegraph Union tried to regulate messages between the countries.
- It was a political game of connections. Especially Prussia, who was trying to spread their influence to the Germanic countries.
##### Morse's Graph
- Morse's telegraph was used officially to connect France, Belgium, Switzerland, Spain, and Sardinia. (pg 69)
The challenge of crossing water led to Morse having a successful experiment across a couple of feet.  He proclaimed that soon we would cross the Atlantic, a plot to try and increase the popularity of his telegraph.
#### Crossing The English Channel
- The water would distort the signal.
#### Competencies on which it lies
- gutta-percha, a kind of rubber, was used. It was expensive but ideal for cable insulation.
#### Consequences 
- very inefficient to get the sap from the trees. Had to cut down the whole tree.
- Very expensive, not economically viable.
- Destroyed these natural forests that the natives had to suffer for.

# Legacy of The Telegraph (page 201)

When Morse died, the role of an 'amateur scientist' died with him (pg 202). I feel like this is because the science has become very complex using a lot of details from many different areas of research that a painter like Morse in the modern day couldn't just quit painting because he heard someone talk about how a phone worked and reinvent the next revolutionary communication method.
It still does take someone with drive and aspiration to create the ideas so that scientists can research them.
There is a trend to the creation of technology I've noticed. It starts out with people like Morse and Chappe to create the initial idea, then they pitch it to established scientist like Thomas or Wheatstone, then once its stable is when businesses will try to swoop it and commercialize it (pg 202).

#### Wheatstone Legacy (pg 203)
- Chevalier of the Legion of Honour, knighted in 1868. 
- Continued to perform experiments with interests in optics, acoustics and electricity.
- Invented the stereoscope and the concertina.
- Died rich and respected.
#### Cooke Legacy (pg 203)
- failed to distinguish himself.
- created stone and slate cutting machines.
- Unsuccessfully designed a rope hauled railway with remote controlled doors.
- Died in 1879
The golden age of the telegraph faded away in the early 20th century (pg 205).
