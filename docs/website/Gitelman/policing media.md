Gitelman states that, "If meanings are imposed by industry, then policing media becomes a viable project: quashing violence on television and labelling offensive lyrics will protect minors from harm and lead to a decrease in violent crime (Gitelman, 2006)." This relates to the January 16th lecture where Graham explains how the people who govern media is what controls a lot of what people know. These big media companies just decided that they were going to start censoring shows and the people had to accept it. The people that decide what media is important has the power to control it.
