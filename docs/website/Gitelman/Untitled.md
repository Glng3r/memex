Gitelman explores the idea of Complex vs Complicated with her quote; "Some seem to arrive [[sui generis]], discrete and fully formed, while many, like digital genres, video rentals, and computer keyboards, emerge as complicated engagements among different media (Giteman,2006)." This follows the idea Graham said in his January 11th lecture by going over the idea of emergence. The idea is that a lot of technology seems very complicated when it first emerges, like the keyboard, but overtime it's more of a complex network of parts then a complicated thing to handle.

{Use this section to think about connections. Think about **how the newly created notes connect with your existing knowledge**. If you find some connections, connect the new notes with the older notes already in your system.To find these, ask:

-   How does this idea fit into what I already know?
-   What does this idea mean for some other idea that I already have?
-   Does this add to, contradict, or explain another idea that I already have?

You link to other notes by putting them in square brackets. Remember that Obsidian will auto search as you type for notes with those words. Once you've selected a note, you can add the ^ symbol to link to a subheading or block within a note, too.}
