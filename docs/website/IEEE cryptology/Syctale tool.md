One of the cryptology tools Graham mentioned in class was the Scytale. According to the IEEE, it originated in Ancient Greece and the premise was very simple, the sender would write a message on a roll of cloth wrapped around a wooden pole and then sent. The only way to decipher it was to have the same diameter wooden pole. It worked but only because long ago not many people could read and write. 
This is an ancient example of a transposition cypher.
