It is very clear throughout the text the many reasons why A Yukon telegraph would be beneficial for Canada, covering a wide variety of reasons such as economics, territorial, the people and independence.

## Economic Reasons
The Economical standpoint of a telegraph becomes apparent when a vast reserve of gold was found near Rabbit Creek in Klondike in 1896. There was also the looming disappointment of The Canadian Pacific Railway that had barely boosted the population throughout the prairies (Miller, 2004)(page 15).

## Political Reasons
There were political reasons as to why Canada was quick to want to connect Yukon because of the newly discovered gold, as it was easier for many Americans to go over to Yukon then Canadians Laurier was afraid it would drift into the hands of the USA(Miller, 2004)(page 16). This is very similar to why the British were so keen on the telegraph, they wanted a stronger hold on colonies such as India for the economic benefits. Canada wanted to keep a hold on the western provinces and territories but communicating with them proved many challenges such as the climate, and it was dangerous to travel to and from the remote cities, keeping them isolated from the government all the way in Ottawa. 
## Safety of the people
It was no secret that the journey in the north was dangerous, especially trying to go between Fort Constantine and a city such as Victoria, it could take weeks over frozen rivers, and it was even impossible at certain times when the rivers were half frozen completely cutting off communication between them and the rest of Canada. The introduction of a telegraph cable will allow them to keep in touch with the rest of the world all year round.
