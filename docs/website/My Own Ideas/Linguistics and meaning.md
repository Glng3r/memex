I know a thing or two about linguistics, so I have a little input. The idea of a telegraph only really works for countries with Latin scripts because the words carry meaning in them. A lot of different languages have a huge emphasis on intonation when speaking that a monotone telegraph cannot simply relay. A lot of conversations simply cannot happen because of this.

An example would be mandarin and the word "ma", could mean mother, numb, horse, to scold, or to even indicate a question. Conversing over the telegraph loses a lot of the meaning. So this medium is not very practical for most Asian countries.
Also, a lot of the Asian languages have thousands of characters, imagine having to make a Morse code for each character it would not be feasible.
