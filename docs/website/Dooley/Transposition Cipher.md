Another basic Cipher Dooley mentions is the transposition cipher. It works by rearranging letters to a specific rule or key. It is very hard to break because there are n [[factorial]] ciphertexts for an n-letter plaintext message. The simplest form would be the columnar transposition (complete and incomplete).  You write the message in columns with rows as long as the key, it is then pulled off by columns according to the key. Example:

if the key was 321654, you would first write the 3rd column then the second so on and until you reach the end. The encoded message would be:
