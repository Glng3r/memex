> - **Abstract:** Thousands of years proved that Cryptography and encryption is been used for secure sheltered communication. The word Cryptography comes from the two Greek words Kryptos means hidden and Graphein means writing. Cryptography, the use of codes and ciphers to protect secrets, since from the ancient times various cryptographic techniques where as symbols used by Egypt, Spartans developed a device called Scytale used by Greece, Julius Caesar developed the Substitution cipher technique for the purpose of military used by Rome, Leon Battista Alberti invented a cipher disk which acts as an encryption system called Vigenere Cipher, Thomas Jefferson invented Wheel Cipher consisting of 26 wheels. Similarly, rulers invented War Driven Cryptography to meet with the outcome of war. Modern cryptographic techniques proves that it is been the trendsetter which ensures high security than ancient times and War Driven Cryptography. To protect a valuable information people develop better ways through a thorough understanding of cryptography and encryption which makes technology more efficient and faster.
