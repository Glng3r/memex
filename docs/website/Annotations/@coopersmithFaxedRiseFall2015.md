> In Bain’s 1843 “improvement for taking copies of surfaces,” the transmitting and receiving plates consisted of a metal frame filled with short, insulated wires bound together with sealing wax and ground smooth. The message on the transmitting plate was made of printers’ type. A pendulum moved a stylus back and forth across each plate. The end of each swing activated clockwork to drop the frame so that the next swing scanned a new line

> In 1846–48, he built a new fax machine with a cylinder replacing the flat plate. Instead of raised type, the sender wrote a message with a non-conducting ink on tin foil or paper coated with Dutch metal (a thin leaf of brass). Weights unwinding by clockwork synchronized the pendulums and moved the stylus gradually across the rotating cylinder.

> Bakewell also employed a rotating cylinder instead of a flat plate and non-conducting ink on a thin sheet of tin foil. The sender wrote his message on a varnish-coated piece of tin foil with an ink containing caustic soda, then wiped the foil with a wet sponge. The foil was wrapped around a six-inch-diameter cylinder, and a stylus scanned the message as the cylinder rotated. Where the soda had removed the varnish, the stylus touched the actual foil, making a circuit.

These lower costs as well as institutional inertia benefitted telegraphy as careers and companies increasingly evolved around dots and dashes instead of images.
>
>> The real reason Morse's system was so good. It was cheap so an average person was able to afford it, it was very simple to learn and use you just had to remember the code for each letter in the alphabet. This led to it being the preferred method, as while Bain's could transmit more data people did not have a use to transmit all that. They wanted a cheap way to communicate with people from far away.

Users and telegraph companies had developed ways to send telegrams securely despite the lack of an exact reproduction of the original message. Korn’s photocell-based machine opened the market of photographs for newspapers and magazines, but the high cost, slow speed, and low resolution deterred successful use.
