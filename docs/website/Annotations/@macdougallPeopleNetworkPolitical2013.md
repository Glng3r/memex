> - **Abstract:** The Bell System dominated telecommunications in the United States and Canada for most of the twentieth century, but its monopoly was not inevitable. In the decades around 1900, ordinary citizens--farmers, doctors, small-town entrepreneurs--established tens of thousands of independent telephone systems, stringing their own wires to bring this new technology to the people. Managed by opportunists and idealists alike, these small businesses were motivated not only by profit but also by the promise of open communication as a weapon against monopoly capital and for protection of regional autonomy. As the Bell empire grew, independents fought fiercely to retain control of their local networks and companies--a struggle with an emerging corporate giant that has been almost entirely forgotten. The People's Network reconstructs the story of the telephone's contentious beginnings, exploring the interplay of political economy, business strategy, and social practice in the creation of modern North American telecommunications. Drawing from government documents in the United States and Canada, independent telephone journals and publications, and the archives of regional Bell operating companies and their rivals, Robert MacDougall locates the national debates over the meaning, use, and organization of the telephone industry as a turning point in the history of information networks. The competing businesses represented dueling political philosophies: regional versus national identity and local versus centralized power. Although independent telephone companies did not win their fight with big business, they fundamentally changed the way telecommunications were conceived.

> This chapter describes three competing visions of telephony—three ways of understanding the technology and its purpose. These three visions and the contests between them would shape the development of telephony for decades to come. Yet all three emerged in the telephone’s early days, and each was championed by one of the Bell companies’ very first leaders. Gardiner Hubbard, the Bell Telephone Company’s first president, was animated by a quasi-populist vision of ‘‘a telephone for the people,’’ which found many adherents, though few at Bell. William Forbes, who pushed Hubbard out of his position as president, embraced a far more conservative vision of the telephone. And Theodore Vail, Bell’s first general manager and later the founder of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, articulated a third vision: an ambitious dream of ‘‘one big system,’’ a single continent-spanning network uniting telephone and telegraph under one corporation’s control.

It served large businesses and very wealthy individuals, and it made possible an unprecedented private monopoly in the national distribution of news and information

> This was the dream of ‘‘one big system’’: a single, continent-spanning telephone network, controlled by one corporation, connecting every subscriber in the nation and perhaps even the world. The man most associated with the idea of a unified Bell System was present in the industry almost from the start. But his dream of consolidation remained idiosyncratic at this time, not embraced by the Boston owners of American Bell, and actively resisted by the decentralized federation of operating companies that made up the nineteenth-century telephone business.

>> The extreme of the three views, total domination of the market. The idea that everything should fall under one company. This would be a horrible idea because this company would pretty much be a dictatorship of what information could and could not be told. They would have complete control of policing the media.

> These technological systems seemed to offer arguments for the ideal of system itself—for the standardization of procedures, the consolidation of ownership, and the centralization of control. ‘‘A railway, like a vast machine, the wheels of which are all connected with each other... requires a certain harmony, [and] cannot be worked by a number of independent agents,’’ declared one 1850 treatise on the economy of railways. ‘‘The organization of a railway requires unity of direction and harmony of movement, which can only be attained by the combination of the entire carrying business with the general administration of the road.’’70 Vail would echo this language all his life.
>
>> The idea of effsioncy was now truly a concern. With the foundation of all these technologies like the railroad, and telegraphy the economy has been increasing tremendously. The idea now is that instead of focusing on a new idea it was better to create systems to improve what they already had, so more people can afford it and also more traffic on the network without increasing scale alone.

American Bell owned about one-third of Bell Canada’s voting stock in 1885 and held four positions on its eight-member board of directors. Bell Canada relied heavily on American Bell for capital and equipment and conferred with Boston on policy and rates.

> But the three traditions represented by Gardiner Hubbard, William Forbes, and Theodore Vail exerted powerful influences in decades to come. Hubbard’s hopeful vision of a telephone for the people, Forbes’s conservative understanding of the same technology, and Vail’s ambitious dream of one big system were all present at or near the birth of the many Bells. These ideas would shape and define the battles over the telephone for many years thereafter
