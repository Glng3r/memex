> I n 1896, when gold was discovered on RabbitCreek in the Klondike, Canada was just beginning to recover from a deep recession that had caused 10 percent of the country's population to flee to the United States. The Canadian Pacific Railway, built to unite the country and promote settlement of the west, had as yet done little to populate the thousand miles of prairie between Manitoba and the Rocky Mountains. The newly elected Liberal government of Wilfrid Laurier had pledged to work aggressively to fill this void with farmers, and there were other pressing issues that demanded the attention of Ottawa, not least the unsettled relationship between the Dominion government and British Columbia.

>> I think this is going to be similar to what the British did to hold onto their colonies, making telegraph lines so they can have a tighter hold on what is going on and an easy way to dictate what they think should be happening. If Canada can create this telegraph line then the dangerouse journey from Yukon to Ottawa would not have to be done for communications.

> Although they did not admit it publicly, the Liberals realized early on that the line was not likely to be profitable as a commercial enterprise. Its raison d'etre was to provide an essential public service for the police and other government officials, and for the people of the Yukon

> Afaster and more reliable system was neededâ€”"urgently needed," according to the comptroller of the NWMP, who suggested that a telegraph or telephone line be constructed from the summit of the Chilkoot Pass to Dawson City, a distance of about 600 miles. It should be an inexpensive line, he wrote, a light wire suspended from standing trees that could later be abandoned
