### Summary & Key Take Aways

In the paper titled _Submarine Telegraph Cables_(2001), Headrick analyzes the many different companies and their impact on the creation of the telegraph network. To build his argument, he looks at many different companies and how they all had an effect on the creation of telegraph lines. He does this to understand the power and dynamics between countries brought about because of the telegraph.
