The internet is an ultimate form of letting anyone access new technology because of how customizable it is. This is in stark contrast to something like the telegraph, which only really worked for languages like English. While with the computer, there are many options to create different pieces of software to incorporate languages such as Chinese. 
There is also the ability to create software to help people with disabilities like being blind or deaf, something that wasn't as feasible with the telegraph.
