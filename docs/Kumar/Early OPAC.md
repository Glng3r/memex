Kumar explicitly states, "one of ITâ€™s greatest accomplishments is transformation of the card catalogue to the OPAC to facilitate libraries (Kumar, 2013)." The ability to have a computer find the information for you was revolutionary at the time. It utilizes a database that stores many points of data like author, title, publisher, and lets the user search by any of these instead of just author or title like with the card catalogue. OPAC is just the name for the software that can be used easily by a trained librarian to search for data. It has multiple use cases like a bibliographic database, a portal to non-bibliographic data, it can even act a promotional device. It essentially takes a card catalogue and puts in on steroids.
