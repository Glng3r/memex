### My own additions:
Max and Rowan did a good job of how politics becomes more of a factor the better our technology gets, so ill add my own input.  A big factor in this is how war has evolved overtime, it has strayed away from which nation can kill the other the fastest and more effective to cultural and intelligence wars. In WW2, a major reason why Germany was so strong was because of their enigma and the intelligence advantage it gave them. With the Cold War, it was about the space race and who could promote their ideologies the best. 

The Whole reason why the telegraph became popular in the first place was Britain wanted a political advantage through instant communication with its colonies. It invested tons of money just to have an advantage over any colonies that tried to rebel.
