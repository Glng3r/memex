## My Own Input
I believe that what Micheal said about the benefits of the telegraph is also true with the internet. While the early advancements of the internet were for military needs, it became very clear that it could also be used for the benefits of others.

I especially like," Communication can unite people from many cultures and origins, promoting better social peace and reducing conflict. In other words, effective communication is crucial for building a world that is joyful, successful, and connected," because a lot of small communities that receive hate can safely communicate thanks to the internet. [[Double-edge sword of being anonymous]]; for this note, specifically focus on the benefits of it.

But when Micheal talks about building trust and ties between countries, that it essentially what The Cold War was, which side's ability to create allies and trust in their ideologies. The benefits of these allies far outweigh the reasons from war.
