### Summary & Key Take Aways

In *A Prehistory of Social Media*, Driscoll goes through the human aspects of using early internet technology such as modems and BBS groups. To build this argument, he goes through different technology and how people used them to connect to each other. Driscoll does this in order to show us that there is much more to the history of the internet then just tecnological advancements.
