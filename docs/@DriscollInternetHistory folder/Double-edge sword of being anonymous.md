Being anonymous is like a double-edged sword, you'll have people who have been searching for a place to fit in and then others trying to be rude and spread hate on the internet.  This is different than early communication technologies like the telegraph, where it was possible to be traced and identified.
One thing I noticed is the medium in which this information is coming from is very important, you have to think about the kind of BBSs it is and the format of the information to discern what the media is about. [[Medium is important]].

> AfroNet offered wide-ranging discussions of Black interest. GayCom connected BBSs for gay and lesbian people. TGnet was dedicated to transgender identity, health, and culture. AEGIS carried information about living with HIV and AIDS. PeaceNet, EcoNet and GreenNet supported the peace and environmentalist movements. Of course, we should avoid an overly romantic portrayal of this period. The political potential of BBS technology was also embraced by white power groups, militias, anti-Semitic conspiracy theorists, and other right-wing extremists.[^1]
