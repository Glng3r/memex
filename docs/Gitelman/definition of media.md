Gitelman eventually defines media as, "socially realized structures of communication, where structures include both technological forms and their associated protocols, and where communication is a cultural practice, a ritualized collocation of different people on the same mental map, sharing or engaged with popular ontologies of representation (Gitelman 2006)." Gitelman is defining media as an ever-changing concept that changes whenever new technologies emerge. Also, when new communication trends develop, media will also have to change to go alongside the new mental stage the community is on.
