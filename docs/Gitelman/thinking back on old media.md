The premise of this note is to comment on this annotation I made during the first edition of my memex and rethink its meaning. When I think of this quote, it makes me compare the early internet from the 90s and the internet of today. While they are both fundamentally the same thing, websites on a browser, I feel like you can't really call it the internet given what we have today. I think this quote was getting at that when time moves on, earlier technology becomes to seem more unreal and pointless compared to the more advanced technology of the modern day.
