When Gitelman says, "and thereby challenge readers to imagine what a meaningful history of today's new media might eventually look like as well as to think about how accounts of media in general should be written (Gitelman, 2006)," she is trying to get the reader to think of a media technology from today's world that is revolutionary will evolve to become more widespread. My example for this would be VR and Mark Zuckerberg's Metaverse, a new way to talk to communicate and work with people through virtual reality. Right now it's more of a concept, but I can picture it becoming more mainstream and advance to the point where company meetings can be handled in VR just like it would in the real world without having to organize a way for everyone to get to the same physical location.
