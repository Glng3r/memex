## Reflection
- tutorial point: "Key Moments that Shaped the Internet".
I don't think my desire for the course was fully reached. Creating the journeys for this final task was a struggle, and I think it was not because I didn't understand what I was learning, but I failed to make connections between the big ideas throughout the separate parts. I was successful in capturing key moments and connecting them throughout other parts in each edition of my memex, but I was not successful in reaching my expectations of connecting throughout the editions.

In the journey I provided at the top I was able to make a decent path between notes of the different memex's, but I was unable to capture a lot of the key moments such as Britain's involvement, the telegraph, the telephone, the ideas of how computers are tools to help us. This show's that while I do have notes and linkages, I wasn't able to capture the significant moments in my notes. These moments are overshadowed by the many smaller notes I have.
To improve this, I should have spent more time gardening out the moments that connect together rather than every little thing that interested me.
