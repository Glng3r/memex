Dooley goes over the two distinct ways of hiding a message so no one other than the recipient receives it. The first is the idea of Steganography, which hides the existence of a message. Think of things like secret ink, and different fonts that make it so only the sender and recipient know that there is a message there. Cryptology would be the opposite of Steganography, leaving the message in plain sight, usually encoded in a way only the two parties on both ends know the code for. 
The term for the creation of a secret message is cryptology and the techniques to crack these secret messages is called cryptanalysis. The person who cryptanalyses text is called a cryptanalyst.
