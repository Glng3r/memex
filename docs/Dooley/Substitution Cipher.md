Dooley mentions the substitution cipher and that it is one of the most simple kind of ciphers, it involves replacing each letter with a different letter or symbol using a map called a cipher alphabet. If you replace a letter with more than one symbol, that becomes a polyalphabetic substitution cipher. 
The most simple kind is the cipher alphabet, in which you shift around the alphabet by a predefined number. If you perform a shift of 7,
Plain: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz 
Cipher: HIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFG
It would turn the word attack into HAAHJR.
It can also be randomly switched around as long as you have the key
Plain: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz 
Cipher: BDOENUZIWLYVJKHMFPTCRXAQSGS
The word enemy becomes NKNJS. This is very similar to the Caesar cipher linked below.
