The telegraph would not work for languages like Japanese, where there are thousands of symbols that may sound similar, but intonation, context, and the symbol itself changes meaning, it would be impossible to have a code for each symbol. Now, if we could transfer writings of the symbols it would be very useful for the billions of people in Asia, a real market.
