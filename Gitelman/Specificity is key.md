In the book by Gitelman she says, "specificity is key. Rather than static, blunt, and unchanging technology, every medium involves a "sequence of displacements and obsolescence, part of the delirious operations of modernization (Gitelman, 2006)."" There are so many different aspects of what the internet is that talking about it is a general way loses a lot of what it is. We can't just say the internet because there is a big network of unique items that could classify under this word. We have to be more specific, like a time and place. This would be an example of a complex system as it has a lot of pieces to it, but any small simple thing can break in it.
