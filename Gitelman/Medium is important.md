Gitelman mentions countless times how the medium of a message is just as important as the message itself. As an example, on page 10 she talks about how the medium is evidence of its own history. The medium essentially carries its intentions throughout the ages. Graham says that the medium is just as important as the message, and the medium is a carrier for media. This accounts to the fact that the medium carries its own history. 

Then, on page 3 Gitelman states that, "a total media link on a digital base will erase the very concept of medium."  I think this is referring to how once everything goes digital, a lot of the context to the media such as the kind of paper used or where it was distributed too will be gone because everything is on a screen.
