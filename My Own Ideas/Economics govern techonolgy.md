I have noticed time and time again that what accelerates or holds back innovation in technology is the ability to market it and make money, as well as the need to crush out other competitors. The whole criteria for if a technology is successful is if it has made money or can make money, if it cannot even if it is a great piece of technology the world sees it as a failure. You notice it especially with the telephone, Bell's refusal to expand and innovate is solely because they are already maximizing their profits with their monopoly.

You even see this with [[Later OPAC upgrades]], it wasn't until it became popular and needed that major developments came to make it easier to use.
