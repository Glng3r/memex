The big ideas for me was not the science and technical details of the technology but what it was used for and how it was accessible to others.  Claude Chappe Signalling Device: It starts by going over how two brothers wanted to communicate from a distance and devised a way to use titling arms as representations of other things to convey messages over distances.  Accessibility with the telegraph: The next step of the journey goes on to explain how this was very complicated and that it wasn't very user-friendly, that we needed a way to simplify it, so a larger group of the population can communicate with each other.  Morse Code: This is where Morse comes in, he devised a way to translate the English alphabet into jolts of electricity to be sent over a copper wire. It is a lot easier to learn 26 codes then the hundreds from the previous model. This is also very important because it is essentially just binary, a quick jolt represents one thing while a long jolt represents another, which can be compared to 1 and 0 of binary. This is significant as it is simplifying how we can send data more efficiently and being conscious of more than just the big inventions like the telegraph. Linguistics and meaning: The next step would be thinking about other languages, such as Chinese, which cannot easily be translated to the telegraph. first computer protocol:  This changes the way we view how we develop new technologies. Instead of everything being done in an expensive lab funded by big corporations or governments, anyone can now contribute to the internet. This took control out of people who wanted money that would inhibit people from researching tech. This connects the idea of British control and how technology at this time only thought about a select group of people instead of the world. British Telegraph Monopoly:  This helps illustrate the differences on why we advance our technologies, not to make money or political reasons but because we are generally interested in the field. Britians Motivation for Telegraphy: The motivation of power and money was at it's strongest when the British Empire was developing the telegraph, it wanted to do whatever it took to be better than other countries. This note connects well because it talks about the reasons why the telegraph became what it is and connects to the shift of motivation for innovation. Accelerating forces other than military: We have come to a point where we can shift from a view of power to one of bettering humanity. This leads us from the tradition of only a few selected people being able to use and research technology like English with Morse code to a world where anyone can access and create anything using the internet.  early boom of the internet: This is the end of the journey because it marks where humanity was at a peak of diversity on the internet. It was a time when absolutely anyone could create a website for any reason, and it would be popular, a place where everyone can find someone to connect with. </li> </ul>"},{"location":"0_Final%20Journey_2/","title":"0 Final Journey 2","text":""},{"location":"0_Final%20Journey_2/#the-journey-between-websitegitelmanemergence-and-websitedenningsciencecomputingarpanet1989-folderfirst-computer-protocol","title":"The Journey Between website/Gitelman/Emergence and website/@denningScienceComputingARPANET1989 folder/first computer protocol","text":"<ul> <li>website/Gitelman/Emergence</li> <li>website/IEEE cryptology/Emergence of the telegraph</li> <li>website/Headrick and Griset/@headrickSubmarineTelegraphCables2001 source</li> <li>website/Headrick and Griset/Accessibility with the telegraph</li> <li>website/Standage/Morse Code</li> <li>website/Gitelman/Medium is important</li> <li>website/@DriscollInternetHistory folder/Double-edge sword of being anonymous</li> <li>website/@UMNEvolutionInternet folder/Neccessities for adoption computers</li> <li>website/@UMNEvolutionInternet folder/@UMNEvolutionInternet source</li> <li>website/@UMNEvolutionInternet folder/Standardization of websites</li> <li>website/@denningScienceComputingARPANET1989 folder/first computer protocol</li> </ul>"},{"location":"0_Final%20Journey_2/#reflection","title":"Reflection","text":"<ul> <li>tutorial point: \"Key Moments that Shaped the Internet\".

It is made up of two halves; cryptography consists of the techniques for creating systems of secret writing and cryptanalysis encompasses the techniques of breaking them. Over the past 2500 years, cryptology has developed numerous types of systems to hide messages and subsequently a rich vocabulary in which to describe them. In this chapter we introduce the reader to the vocabulary of cryptology, explain the differences between codes and ciphers and begin the discussion of how to decipher an unknown message.</p>"},{"location":"Annotations/%40dooleyIntroductionRevolutionaryCipher2018/#annotations","title":"Annotations","text":"<p>%% begin annotations %%</p>"},{"location":"Annotations/%40dooleyIntroductionRevolutionaryCipher2018/#imported-on-2023-02-02-142-pm","title":"Imported on 2023-02-02 1:42 pm","text":""},{"location":"Annotations/%40dooleyIntroductionRevolutionaryCipher2018/#relevant-important","title":"Relevant / important","text":"<p>[!quote|#a28ae5] Highlight In early August 1775 a young patriot from Newport, Rhode Island named Godfrey Wenwood received a request from his ex-wife, Mary Butler Wenwood.

In the late nineteenth century, British firms held a near monopoly, because Britain had more advanced industry, a wealthier capital market, and a merchant marine and colonial empire that provided customers for the new service. After the 1880s, they encountered increasing competition on the North Atlantic from American, German, and French firms. Elsewhere, the British conglomerate Eastern and Associated retained its hegemony until the 1920s. Following World War I, radiotelegraphy threatened the dominance of cables. In the 1930s, cable companies were almost bankrupted by the Depression and by competition from shortwave radio. - Bibliography: Headrick, DR and Griset, P. 2001 Submarine Telegraph Cables: Business and Politics, 1838-1939.

In the decades around 1900, ordinary citizens--farmers, doctors, small-town entrepreneurs--established tens of thousands of independent telephone systems, stringing their own wires to bring this new technology to the people. Managed by opportunists and idealists alike, these small businesses were motivated not only by profit but also by the promise of open communication as a weapon against monopoly capital and for protection of regional autonomy. As the Bell empire grew, independents fought fiercely to retain control of their local networks and companies--a struggle with an emerging corporate giant that has been almost entirely forgotten. The People's Network reconstructs the story of the telephone's contentious beginnings, exploring the interplay of political economy, business strategy, and social practice in the creation of modern North American telecommunications. Drawing from government documents in the United States and Canada, independent telephone journals and publications, and the archives of regional Bell operating companies and their rivals, Robert MacDougall locates the national debates over the meaning, use, and organization of the telephone industry as a turning point in the history of information networks. The competing businesses represented dueling political philosophies: regional versus national identity and local versus centralized power.

William Forbes, who pushed Hubbard out of his position as president, embraced a far more conservative vision of the telephone.

A series of continuous changes through the ages, in both, conventional and non-conventional catalogues, including recent technology inputs added various features to the present day catalogue. Today the computerised catalogue may function like a portal and this function can be exploited infinitely to connect to a variety of data considered useful for library users. The system designers are trying to adopt new trends in OPACs. Web-based catalogues initiated Web 2.0 trends like RSS feeds, blogs, downloadable e-media, and instant messages.

Cryptology would be the opposite of Steganography, leaving the message in plain sight, usually encoded in a way only the two parties on both ends know the code for.

The most simple kind is the cipher alphabet, in which you shift around the alphabet by a predefined number.

He builds this argument by going over the three timeframes for Bell under three key leaders, Gardiner Hubbard, William Forbes, and Theodore Veil. MacDougall highlights these three key timeframes because it is the foundation of the modern telephone networks we see today and the backstory to why Bell is big in Canada and AT&amp;T is a big corporation in America.</p> <p>The first of the three is Gardiner Hubbard (linked because his backstory is cool), whose vision was a \"telephone for the people,\" a telephone that was not exploited for profit, one that can be used freely by the people. The next is William Forbes, an autocrat who took over when the Bell Company was in dire need of funds, his whole goal was to milk the people for as much money as he could, the complete opposite of Hubbard's Vision. Finally, we have Theodore Vail he was ambitious, he wanted the whole world to be connected by one company. Vail could also be seen as a genius for his ideas. While with the Bell Company, he tried to sell as many telephones to as many people possible, even if it was not profitable in the slightest. </p>"},{"location":"MacDougall%20People%27s%20Network/%40macdougallPeopleNetworkPolitical2013%20source/#links","title":"Links","text":"<p>Ambition Business differences for the telephone Collapsing space time with the telephone privitizing the telephone segregation with telephone The alliance of Bell and Western Union Turnaround of Bell's Ideals</p>"},{"location":"MacDougall%20People%27s%20Network/Ambition/","title":"memex2 #Technological-innovations","text":"<p>[!quote|#a28ae5] Highlight The lines of this association . . . will connect one or more points in each and every city, town or place in the State of New York with one or more points in each and every other city, town or place in said state, and in each and every other of the United States, and in Canada and Mexico; and each and every other of said cities, towns and places is to be connected with each and every other city, town or place . . . and also by cable and other appropriate means with the rest of the known world.</p> <p>Ambition is good!
