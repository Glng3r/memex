Kumar went over a time after the International Conference on Cataloging Principles (ICCP) held in Paris in 1961. There were a total of 53 countries and 12 internation organization's in attendance. It did not go so well as several nations rejected it. It did create the Anglo-American Cataloguing Riles (AACR). Also, it leads the way for the General International Standard Bibliographic Description (ISBD (G)) in 1975. Furthermore, it was created to keep uniformity in how catalogs were recorded. Which made a huge impact for Accessibility of information as it made AACR make changes to include materials for the blind, sound recordings, and music.
